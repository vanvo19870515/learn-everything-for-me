- An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods (prior to Java 8). A class can implement multiple interfaces but can extend only one abstract class.

### 32. What is a functional interface?
- A functional interface is an interface that has exactly one abstract method. They can be used as the assignment target for lambda expressions.

### 33. What are the access modifiers in Java?
- The access modifiers in Java are public, protected, private, and package-private (default). They control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables.

### 34. What is method overloading?
- Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists (types or number of parameters).

### 35. What is the transient keyword?
- The transient keyword is used in serialization to indicate that a field should not be serialized. It will not be saved when the object is converted to a byte stream.

### 36. Explain the concept of polymorphism in Java.
- Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.

- The clone() method is used to create a copy of an object. The class must implement the Cloneable interface to allow cloning.

### 38. What is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
- A shallow copy creates a new object but copies the references of the original object's fields. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all fields, creating copies of mutable objects.

### 39. What is a package in Java?
- A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. It helps avoid naming conflicts and controls access.

### 40. What is the purpose of the volatile keyword?
- The volatile keyword indicates that a variable's value will be modified by different threads. It ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads.

### 41. What is the java.lang.Object class?

### 46. How do you create a thread in Java?
- You can create a thread by either extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface and then passing an instance of the Runnable to a Thread object.

### 47. What is the purpose of the synchronized keyword?
- The synchronized keyword is used to control access to a method or block by multiple threads, ensuring that only one thread can execute it at a time.

### 48. What is the difference between Runnable and Callable?
- Runnable does not return a result and cannot throw checked exceptions, while Callable can return a result and can throw checked exceptions.

### 49. What is the purpose of the try-with-resources statement?
- The try-with-resources statement is used to automatically close resources (like files or sockets) after use, ensuring proper resource management.

### 50. What is the difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
- HashMap is not synchronized and allows null keys and values, while Hashtable is synchronized and does not allow null keys or values.

### 51. What is the java.util.Optional class?
- The Optional class is a container object which may or may not contain a value. It is used to avoid NullPointerExceptions and to represent optional values.

### 52. How do you sort a list in Java?
- You can sort a list using the Collections.sort() method or the List.sort() method, providing a comparator if needed.

### 53. What is the purpose of the Stream API in Java?
- The Stream API is used to process sequences of elements (collections) in a functional style, allowing for operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

### 54. What is the difference between Map and Set?
- A Map stores key-value pairs, where each key is unique, while a Set stores unique elements without any specific order.

### 55. What are the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
- The main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

### 56. What is the purpose of the default keyword in interfaces?
- The default keyword allows you to add new methods to interfaces with a default implementation without breaking existing implementations.

### 57. What is the significance of the native keyword?
- The native keyword indicates that a method is implemented in platform-specific code (usually C or C++) outside of the Java runtime.

### 58. What is the difference between a constructor and a method?
- A constructor is called when an object is created and does not have a return type, while a method is called to perform a specific task and has a return type.

### 59. What is a singleton class?
- A singleton class is a class that allows only one instance of itself to be created and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### 60. How do you implement a thread-safe singleton in Java?
- You can implement a thread-safe singleton using the double-checked locking pattern or by using an enum, which is inherently thread-safe.
