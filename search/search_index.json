What are different types of waits in Selenium? Selenium provides three types of waits to handle synchronization: - Implicit Wait: Sets a default waiting time for all elements.   <pre><code>driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));\n</code></pre> - Explicit Wait: Waits for specific conditions on particular elements.   <pre><code>WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));\nwait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"submitBtn\")));\n</code></pre> - Fluent Wait: Custom polling and exception handling.   <pre><code>Wait&lt;WebDriver&gt; wait = new FluentWait&lt;&gt;(driver)\n    .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n    .pollingEvery(Duration.ofMillis(500))\n    .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);\nwait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"element\")));\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q2. Explain the difference between <code>findElement()</code> and <code>findElements()</code>. - <code>findElement()</code>: Returns a single <code>WebElement</code>; throws <code>NoSuchElementException</code> if not found. <pre><code>WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id(\"username\"));\n</code></pre> - <code>findElements()</code>: Returns a <code>List&lt;WebElement&gt;</code>; returns empty list if none found. <pre><code>List&lt;WebElement&gt; elements = driver.findElements(By.className(\"item\"));\n</code></pre> Use <code>findElement()</code> when exactly one element is expected; <code>findElements()</code> for zero-or-many.</p> <p>Q3. What are XPath and CSS Selector? When to use each? - XPath: Powerful, can traverse both directions. <code>By.xpath(\"//button[@id='submit' and @class='primary']\")</code> <code>By.xpath(\"//div[contains(@class, 'error-message')]\")</code> - CSS Selector: Faster, concise for most cases. <code>By.cssSelector(\"button#submit.primary\")</code> <code>By.cssSelector(\"div.error-message\")</code> Use CSS for simple stable locators; XPath for complex relations or when traversing parents/siblings.</p> <p>Q4. How to handle dynamic elements / changing IDs? Strategies: 1. Partial attribute match <code>By.xpath(\"//button[starts-with(@id, 'btn_')]\")</code> <code>By.cssSelector(\"button[id*='dynamic']\")</code> 2. Relative XPath by text <code>By.xpath(\"//button[contains(text(), 'Submit')]\")</code> <code>By.xpath(\"//label[text()='Username']/following::input\")</code> 3. Wait for presence/clickable <pre><code>WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));\nwait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(\n    By.xpath(\"//button[contains(@class, 'dynamic')]\")));\n</code></pre> 4. Explicit wait then interact <pre><code>WebElement element = wait.until(\n    ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\"//button[@onclick*='submit']\")));\nelement.click();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q5. Explain the Page Object Model (POM) pattern and its advantages. Each page = class; locators + actions encapsulated. <pre><code>public class LoginPage {\n  private WebDriver driver;\n  private By username = By.id(\"username\");\n  private By password = By.id(\"password\");\n  private By loginBtn = By.id(\"loginBtn\");\n\n  public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) { this.driver = driver; }\n  public void enterUsername(String u) { driver.findElement(username).sendKeys(u); }\n  public void enterPassword(String p) { driver.findElement(password).sendKeys(p); }\n  public DashboardPage clickLogin() { driver.findElement(loginBtn).click(); return new DashboardPage(driver); }\n}\n</code></pre> Advantages: centralized locators, maintainability, reduced duplication, readable tests, separation of concerns.</p> <p>Q6. Difference between Actions class and direct element methods? - Direct: simple interactions (<code>click()</code>, <code>sendKeys()</code>). - Actions: complex gestures (hover, drag-drop, right-click, key chords). <pre><code>Actions actions = new Actions(driver);\nactions.moveToElement(el).click().perform();\nactions.dragAndDrop(src, dst).perform();\nactions.keyDown(Keys.SHIFT).click(el).keyUp(Keys.SHIFT).perform();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q7. How do you handle <code>StaleElementReferenceException</code>? - Re-locate element after DOM change. - Use explicit waits for presence/visibility. - Retry on stale within a loop. <pre><code>int attempts = 0;\nwhile (attempts &lt; 3) {\n  try { driver.findElement(By.id(\"element\")).click(); break; }\n  catch (StaleElementReferenceException e) { attempts++; }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q8. Locator strategies and reliability order. 1) ID, 2) Name, 3) CSS, 4) XPath, 5) LinkText/Partial, 6) ClassName, 7) TagName. Prefer ID/CSS; avoid brittle complex XPaths.</p> <p>Q9. Differences: <code>driver.navigate()</code>, <code>driver.get()</code>, <code>driver.switchTo()</code> - <code>get(url)</code>: Loads URL, waits for load. - <code>navigate().to/back/forward/refresh()</code>: Adds history control. - <code>switchTo()</code>: Change context (frames, windows, alerts).</p> <p>Q10. Handling pop-ups, alerts, dialogs. - Alerts: <code>Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert(); alert.accept();</code> - Windows: store main handle, iterate <code>getWindowHandles()</code>, switch. - Frames: <code>switchTo().frame(name|index|element)</code>, then <code>defaultContent()</code> / <code>parentFrame()</code>.</p> <p>Q11. Implicit vs Explicit vs Fluent Wait (practical). | Scenario | Wait Type | Example | | --- | --- | --- | | Page-wide default wait | Implicit | <code>implicitlyWait(10s)</code> | | Specific element condition | Explicit | <code>new WebDriverWait(...).until(visibilityOf(...))</code> | | Custom polling/ignores | Fluent | <code>new FluentWait(...).pollingEvery(500ms)...</code> | Best practice: avoid mixing implicit with explicit; prefer explicit/fluent.</p> <p>Q12. Screenshots and visual reports. <pre><code>File shot = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\nFileUtils.copyFile(shot, new File(\"./screenshots/test_\"+System.currentTimeMillis()+\".png\"));\n// Element screenshot (Selenium 4)\nFile elem = element.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\n</code></pre> For reports, integrate ExtentReports / Allure and attach images (path or Base64).</p> <p>Q13. Handling SSL certificate errors. <pre><code>ChromeOptions opt = new ChromeOptions(); opt.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true);\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(opt);\n// Similar for FirefoxOptions/EdgeOptions\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q14. Keyboard and mouse interactions. <pre><code>Actions a = new Actions(driver);\na.sendKeys(Keys.ENTER).perform();\na.click(element).doubleClick(element).contextClick(element).perform();\na.dragAndDrop(src, dst).perform();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q15. <code>switchTo()</code> for frames/windows. - Frames: <code>frame(index|name|element)</code>, <code>parentFrame()</code>, <code>defaultContent()</code>. - Windows: iterate handles, <code>switchTo().window(handle)</code>, return to main.</p> <p>Q16. File uploads / downloads. - Upload: <code>element.sendKeys(\"C:\\\\path\\\\file.txt\");</code> - Downloads: set browser prefs to auto-download; verify file exists in download dir.</p> <p>Q17. Common ExpectedConditions (WebDriverWait). <code>presenceOfElementLocated</code>, <code>visibilityOfElementLocated</code>, <code>elementToBeClickable</code>, <code>textToBePresentInElement</code>, <code>stalenessOf</code>, <code>invisibilityOfElementLocated</code>, <code>numberOfElementsToBeMoreThan</code>, <code>urlContains</code>, <code>alertIsPresent</code>.</p> <p>Q18. Execute JavaScript in Selenium. <pre><code>JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njs.executeScript(\"arguments[0].click();\", element);\njs.executeScript(\"arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);\", element);\nString value = (String) js.executeScript(\"return arguments[0].textContent;\", element);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q19. Headless browser testing (pros/cons). - Pros: faster, lower resource, CI-friendly, good for parallel. - Cons: no visuals, some JS/CSS differences, harder debug. <pre><code>ChromeOptions o = new ChromeOptions(); o.addArguments(\"--headless=new\");\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(o);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q20. Test data &amp; env configuration. Use properties/JSON, config reader, env-specific files. <pre><code>Properties p = new Properties();\np.load(new FileInputStream(\"./config.properties\"));\nString url = p.getProperty(\"base.url\");\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"Experienced_Automation_Tester_QA/#section-2-core-java-20-questions","title":"Section 2: Core Java (20 Questions)","text":"<p>Q21. OOP concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction. - Encapsulation: hide data via accessors. - Inheritance: reuse / IS-A. - Polymorphism: overloading/overriding. - Abstraction: abstract classes/interfaces.</p> <p>Q22. Static vs non-static members. Static: class-level, single copy, accessed via class, hidden not overridden. Non-static: per-instance, can be overridden.</p> <p>Q23. Exception hierarchy &amp; handling. <code>Throwable -&gt; Error / Exception -&gt; (Checked / Runtime)</code>. Use try-catch-finally, multi-catch, try-with-resources, <code>throw/throws</code>.</p> <p>Q24. Checked vs unchecked exceptions. Checked must be declared/caught (e.g., IOException); unchecked extend RuntimeException (e.g., NPE).</p> <p>Q25. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer. Immutable vs mutable; thread-safety (StringBuffer synchronized); performance.</p> <p>Q26. Access modifiers scope. <code>public</code> (anywhere), <code>protected</code> (package + subclasses), default (package), <code>private</code> (class).</p> <p>Q27. Interfaces vs abstract classes. Interface = contract (single/multiple), default/static methods allowed. Abstract class = partial impl, state + behavior, single inheritance.</p> <p>Q28. Overloading vs overriding. Overloading: same name, different params (compile-time). Overriding: subclass redefines (runtime).</p> <p>Q29. <code>final</code> keyword uses. Final class (no extend), final method (no override), final variable (const).</p> <p>Q30. Pass-by-value in Java. Primitives copy value; object references copied (object mutable, reference reassignment not reflected).</p> <p>Q31. Constructors: default, parameterized, copy. Used for initialization; copy constructor to clone state.</p> <p>Q32. <code>this</code> and <code>super</code>. <code>this</code> current instance; <code>super</code> parent access/constructor.</p> <p>Q33. <code>instanceof</code> usage. Type checking before casting; e.g., driver instanceof ChromeDriver.</p> <p>Q34. Memory management &amp; GC; leaks. Heap vs Stack; eligible for GC when unreferenced; avoid static collections holding onto objects.</p> <p>Q35. Wrapper classes, auto-boxing/unboxing. Primitives to objects and back; needed for generics/collections.</p> <p>Q36. <code>==</code> vs <code>.equals()</code>. <code>==</code> reference (objects) / value (primitives); <code>.equals()</code> content (override for custom).</p> <p>Q37. Immutability &amp; creating immutable classes. Final class, final fields, no setters, defensive copies.</p> <p>Q38. Generics for type safety. Compile-time checks, no casting; bounded generics.</p> <p>Q39. HashMap vs Hashtable. HashMap not synchronized, allows null; Hashtable synchronized, legacy.</p> <p>Q40. Lambda expressions &amp; functional interfaces. Single Abstract Method (SAM); use Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier; method refs.</p>"},{"location":"Experienced_Automation_Tester_QA/#section-3-java-collections-framework-15-questions","title":"Section 3: Java Collections Framework (15 Questions)","text":"<p>Q41. Collection hierarchy; Collection vs Collections. Collection = root interface (List/Set/Queue). Collections = utility class (static helpers).</p> <p>Q42. ArrayList vs LinkedList vs Vector. ArrayList: random access, dynamic array. LinkedList: fast insert/delete mid, queue/deque. Vector: legacy synchronized.</p> <p>Q43. HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet. HashSet: no order, O(1). TreeSet: sorted, O(log n), no null. LinkedHashSet: insertion order.</p> <p>Q44. HashMap vs TreeMap vs LinkedHashMap. HashMap: no order, allows null. TreeMap: sorted by key, no null key. LinkedHashMap: insertion order.</p> <p>Q45. Comparable vs Comparator. Comparable = natural ordering inside class; Comparator = external multiple orderings.</p> <p>Q46. Iterator and safe removal. Use iterator.remove() or <code>removeIf</code>; avoid modifying during enhanced for.</p> <p>Q47. Fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators. Fail-fast (ArrayList, HashMap) throw CME on modification. Fail-safe (ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList) work on snapshot.</p> <p>Q48. <code>stream()</code> vs <code>parallelStream()</code>. Sequential vs parallel processing; order guarantees differ; use parallel for large CPU-bound tasks when order not critical.</p> <p>Q49. Queue, Deque, PriorityQueue. Queue FIFO; Deque double-ended; PriorityQueue ordered by priority/comparator.</p> <p>Q50. Map.Entry iteration methods. <code>entrySet()</code>, <code>keySet()</code>, <code>values()</code>, <code>forEach</code>, streams.</p> <p>Q51. Fail-fast vs fail-safe collections (expanded). Fail-fast throw CME on concurrent modification; fail-safe use copy/snapshot (no CME, may not reflect latest).</p> <p>Q52. Stream ops: filter/map/flatMap/reduce/collect. Examples for even filter, mapping, flattening, reducing sum/product, collecting to list/set/map/grouping.</p> <p>Q53. Array vs ArrayList. Fixed vs dynamic size; primitives allowed in arrays; ArrayList objects only; richer API.</p> <p>Q54. Difference List vs Set vs Map.

Mutation testing helps expose weak tests\u2014for example, tests that only check data types but not calculation logic.\"</p> <p>Question: \"When should mutation testing be used?\"</p> <p>30-second Answer:</p> <p>\"I use mutation testing for core business logic\u2014like calculating payments, taxes, or complex validation.

Login to account with valid credit card\n2. Add any product to cart\n3. Navigate to checkout\n4. Fill all required fields\n5. On \"Place Order\" page, quickly click button 5 times (within 500ms)\n6. Observe network requests\n\nExpected Result\n- Only one payment transaction processed\n- One order created\n- One charge on credit card\n- Button becomes disabled after first click\n\nActual Result\n- Multiple payment API calls (/api/v1/payments)\n- Multiple orders created (Order #1001, #1002, #1003)\n- Multiple charges on credit card ($49.99 \u00d7 3)\n- Button remains enabled during processing\n\nEvidence\n1. Screenshot: duplicate_orders.png\n2.

Database State:\n- 3 orders with same cart items\n\nRoot Cause Analysis\n- Payment button lacks debouncing mechanism. Frontend sends request without waiting for response or disabling button.\n\nSeverity: \n- Critical\n=&gt; Why: Causes direct financial loss, violates PCI compliance principles.\n\nPriority: \n- P0 (Immediate Fix)\n=&gt; Why: Actively affecting customers, high support volume.\n\nWorkaround\n- Educate support team to process refunds. Add banner warning users not to click multiple times.\n\nSuggested Fix\n// Frontend: Add debouncing and disable button\nconst placeOrder = debounce(async () =&gt; {\n  placeOrderButton.disabled = true;\n  try {\n    await processPayment();\n  } finally {\n    placeOrderButton.disabled = false;\n  }\n}, 1000);\n\n//Backend: Add idempotency key\nPOST /api/v1/payments\nHeaders: { \"Idempotency-Key\": \"cart_123_session_456\" }\nStatus: \nAssigned To: [Backend Lead]\nDue Date: 2024-01-17\nCurrent Status: In Progress\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"qa-sdet-roadmap/#day-3-4-bug-triage-prioritization-matrix","title":"Day 3-4: Bug Triage &amp; Prioritization Matrix","text":"<p>BUG PRIORITIZATION MATRIX</p> <p>Severity vs Priority</p> Severity (Technical Impact) - Critical: System crash, data loss, security breach - Major: Feature broken, workaround exists - Minor: Feature partially works, cosmetic issues - Trivial: Typos, minor UI misalignment Priority (Business Impact) - P0: Fix immediately (blocking release/production) - P1: Fix in current sprint - P2: Fix in next sprint - P3: Fix when resources available"},{"location":"qa-sdet-roadmap/#decision-matrix","title":"Decision Matrix","text":"Severity \u2193 Priority \u2192 P0 P1 P2 P3 Critical Always P0 \u2713 Major Depends on: \u2022 # of users affected \u2022 Workaround exists \u2022 Business critical feature \u2713 Minor Usually P2 Trivial Usually P3 Real Examples: 1.
