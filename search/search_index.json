What are different types of waits in Selenium? Selenium provides three types of waits to handle synchronization: - Implicit Wait: Sets a default waiting time for all elements.   <pre><code>driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));\n</code></pre> - Explicit Wait: Waits for specific conditions on particular elements.   <pre><code>WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));\nwait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"submitBtn\")));\n</code></pre> - Fluent Wait: Custom polling and exception handling.   <pre><code>Wait&lt;WebDriver&gt; wait = new FluentWait&lt;&gt;(driver)\n    .withTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n    .pollingEvery(Duration.ofMillis(500))\n    .ignoring(NoSuchElementException.class);\nwait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id(\"element\")));\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q2. Explain the difference between <code>findElement()</code> and <code>findElements()</code>. - <code>findElement()</code>: Returns a single <code>WebElement</code>; throws <code>NoSuchElementException</code> if not found. <pre><code>WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id(\"username\"));\n</code></pre> - <code>findElements()</code>: Returns a <code>List&lt;WebElement&gt;</code>; returns empty list if none found. <pre><code>List&lt;WebElement&gt; elements = driver.findElements(By.className(\"item\"));\n</code></pre> Use <code>findElement()</code> when exactly one element is expected; <code>findElements()</code> for zero-or-many.</p> <p>Q3. What are XPath and CSS Selector? When to use each? - XPath: Powerful, can traverse both directions. <code>By.xpath(\"//button[@id='submit' and @class='primary']\")</code> <code>By.xpath(\"//div[contains(@class, 'error-message')]\")</code> - CSS Selector: Faster, concise for most cases. <code>By.cssSelector(\"button#submit.primary\")</code> <code>By.cssSelector(\"div.error-message\")</code> Use CSS for simple stable locators; XPath for complex relations or when traversing parents/siblings.</p> <p>Q4. How to handle dynamic elements / changing IDs? Strategies: 1. Partial attribute match <code>By.xpath(\"//button[starts-with(@id, 'btn_')]\")</code> <code>By.cssSelector(\"button[id*='dynamic']\")</code> 2. Relative XPath by text <code>By.xpath(\"//button[contains(text(), 'Submit')]\")</code> <code>By.xpath(\"//label[text()='Username']/following::input\")</code> 3. Wait for presence/clickable <pre><code>WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));\nwait.until(ExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocated(\n    By.xpath(\"//button[contains(@class, 'dynamic')]\")));\n</code></pre> 4. Explicit wait then interact <pre><code>WebElement element = wait.until(\n    ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.xpath(\"//button[@onclick*='submit']\")));\nelement.click();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q5. Explain the Page Object Model (POM) pattern and its advantages. Each page = class; locators + actions encapsulated. <pre><code>public class LoginPage {\n  private WebDriver driver;\n  private By username = By.id(\"username\");\n  private By password = By.id(\"password\");\n  private By loginBtn = By.id(\"loginBtn\");\n\n  public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) { this.driver = driver; }\n  public void enterUsername(String u) { driver.findElement(username).sendKeys(u); }\n  public void enterPassword(String p) { driver.findElement(password).sendKeys(p); }\n  public DashboardPage clickLogin() { driver.findElement(loginBtn).click(); return new DashboardPage(driver); }\n}\n</code></pre> Advantages: centralized locators, maintainability, reduced duplication, readable tests, separation of concerns.</p> <p>Q6. Difference between Actions class and direct element methods? - Direct: simple interactions (<code>click()</code>, <code>sendKeys()</code>). - Actions: complex gestures (hover, drag-drop, right-click, key chords). <pre><code>Actions actions = new Actions(driver);\nactions.moveToElement(el).click().perform();\nactions.dragAndDrop(src, dst).perform();\nactions.keyDown(Keys.SHIFT).click(el).keyUp(Keys.SHIFT).perform();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q7. How do you handle <code>StaleElementReferenceException</code>? - Re-locate element after DOM change. - Use explicit waits for presence/visibility. - Retry on stale within a loop. <pre><code>int attempts = 0;\nwhile (attempts &lt; 3) {\n  try { driver.findElement(By.id(\"element\")).click(); break; }\n  catch (StaleElementReferenceException e) { attempts++; }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q8. Locator strategies and reliability order. 1) ID, 2) Name, 3) CSS, 4) XPath, 5) LinkText/Partial, 6) ClassName, 7) TagName. Prefer ID/CSS; avoid brittle complex XPaths.</p> <p>Q9. Differences: <code>driver.navigate()</code>, <code>driver.get()</code>, <code>driver.switchTo()</code> - <code>get(url)</code>: Loads URL, waits for load. - <code>navigate().to/back/forward/refresh()</code>: Adds history control. - <code>switchTo()</code>: Change context (frames, windows, alerts).</p> <p>Q10. Handling pop-ups, alerts, dialogs. - Alerts: <code>Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert(); alert.accept();</code> - Windows: store main handle, iterate <code>getWindowHandles()</code>, switch. - Frames: <code>switchTo().frame(name|index|element)</code>, then <code>defaultContent()</code> / <code>parentFrame()</code>.</p> <p>Q11. Implicit vs Explicit vs Fluent Wait (practical). | Scenario | Wait Type | Example | | --- | --- | --- | | Page-wide default wait | Implicit | <code>implicitlyWait(10s)</code> | | Specific element condition | Explicit | <code>new WebDriverWait(...).until(visibilityOf(...))</code> | | Custom polling/ignores | Fluent | <code>new FluentWait(...).pollingEvery(500ms)...</code> | Best practice: avoid mixing implicit with explicit; prefer explicit/fluent.</p> <p>Q12. Screenshots and visual reports. <pre><code>File shot = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\nFileUtils.copyFile(shot, new File(\"./screenshots/test_\"+System.currentTimeMillis()+\".png\"));\n// Element screenshot (Selenium 4)\nFile elem = element.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\n</code></pre> For reports, integrate ExtentReports / Allure and attach images (path or Base64).</p> <p>Q13. Handling SSL certificate errors. <pre><code>ChromeOptions opt = new ChromeOptions(); opt.setAcceptInsecureCerts(true);\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(opt);\n// Similar for FirefoxOptions/EdgeOptions\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q14. Keyboard and mouse interactions. <pre><code>Actions a = new Actions(driver);\na.sendKeys(Keys.ENTER).perform();\na.click(element).doubleClick(element).contextClick(element).perform();\na.dragAndDrop(src, dst).perform();\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q15. <code>switchTo()</code> for frames/windows. - Frames: <code>frame(index|name|element)</code>, <code>parentFrame()</code>, <code>defaultContent()</code>. - Windows: iterate handles, <code>switchTo().window(handle)</code>, return to main.</p> <p>Q16. File uploads / downloads. - Upload: <code>element.sendKeys(\"C:\\\\path\\\\file.txt\");</code> - Downloads: set browser prefs to auto-download; verify file exists in download dir.</p> <p>Q17. Common ExpectedConditions (WebDriverWait). <code>presenceOfElementLocated</code>, <code>visibilityOfElementLocated</code>, <code>elementToBeClickable</code>, <code>textToBePresentInElement</code>, <code>stalenessOf</code>, <code>invisibilityOfElementLocated</code>, <code>numberOfElementsToBeMoreThan</code>, <code>urlContains</code>, <code>alertIsPresent</code>.</p> <p>Q18. Execute JavaScript in Selenium. <pre><code>JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\njs.executeScript(\"arguments[0].click();\", element);\njs.executeScript(\"arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);\", element);\nString value = (String) js.executeScript(\"return arguments[0].textContent;\", element);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q19. Headless browser testing (pros/cons). - Pros: faster, lower resource, CI-friendly, good for parallel. - Cons: no visuals, some JS/CSS differences, harder debug. <pre><code>ChromeOptions o = new ChromeOptions(); o.addArguments(\"--headless=new\");\nWebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(o);\n</code></pre></p> <p>Q20. Test data &amp; env configuration. Use properties/JSON, config reader, env-specific files. <pre><code>Properties p = new Properties();\np.load(new FileInputStream(\"./config.properties\"));\nString url = p.getProperty(\"base.url\");\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"Experienced_Automation_Tester_QA/#section-2-core-java-20-questions","title":"Section 2: Core Java (20 Questions)","text":"<p>Q21. OOP concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction. - Encapsulation: hide data via accessors. - Inheritance: reuse / IS-A. - Polymorphism: overloading/overriding. - Abstraction: abstract classes/interfaces.</p> <p>Q22. Static vs non-static members. Static: class-level, single copy, accessed via class, hidden not overridden. Non-static: per-instance, can be overridden.</p> <p>Q23. Exception hierarchy &amp; handling. <code>Throwable -&gt; Error / Exception -&gt; (Checked / Runtime)</code>. Use try-catch-finally, multi-catch, try-with-resources, <code>throw/throws</code>.</p> <p>Q24. Checked vs unchecked exceptions. Checked must be declared/caught (e.g., IOException); unchecked extend RuntimeException (e.g., NPE).</p> <p>Q25. String vs StringBuilder vs StringBuffer. Immutable vs mutable; thread-safety (StringBuffer synchronized); performance.</p> <p>Q26. Access modifiers scope. <code>public</code> (anywhere), <code>protected</code> (package + subclasses), default (package), <code>private</code> (class).</p> <p>Q27. Interfaces vs abstract classes. Interface = contract (single/multiple), default/static methods allowed. Abstract class = partial impl, state + behavior, single inheritance.</p> <p>Q28. Overloading vs overriding. Overloading: same name, different params (compile-time). Overriding: subclass redefines (runtime).</p> <p>Q29. <code>final</code> keyword uses. Final class (no extend), final method (no override), final variable (const).</p> <p>Q30. Pass-by-value in Java. Primitives copy value; object references copied (object mutable, reference reassignment not reflected).</p> <p>Q31. Constructors: default, parameterized, copy. Used for initialization; copy constructor to clone state.</p> <p>Q32. <code>this</code> and <code>super</code>. <code>this</code> current instance; <code>super</code> parent access/constructor.</p> <p>Q33. <code>instanceof</code> usage. Type checking before casting; e.g., driver instanceof ChromeDriver.</p> <p>Q34. Memory management &amp; GC; leaks. Heap vs Stack; eligible for GC when unreferenced; avoid static collections holding onto objects.</p> <p>Q35. Wrapper classes, auto-boxing/unboxing. Primitives to objects and back; needed for generics/collections.</p> <p>Q36. <code>==</code> vs <code>.equals()</code>. <code>==</code> reference (objects) / value (primitives); <code>.equals()</code> content (override for custom).</p> <p>Q37. Immutability &amp; creating immutable classes. Final class, final fields, no setters, defensive copies.</p> <p>Q38. Generics for type safety. Compile-time checks, no casting; bounded generics.</p> <p>Q39. HashMap vs Hashtable. HashMap not synchronized, allows null; Hashtable synchronized, legacy.</p> <p>Q40. Lambda expressions &amp; functional interfaces. Single Abstract Method (SAM); use Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier; method refs.</p>"},{"location":"Experienced_Automation_Tester_QA/#section-3-java-collections-framework-15-questions","title":"Section 3: Java Collections Framework (15 Questions)","text":"<p>Q41. Collection hierarchy; Collection vs Collections. Collection = root interface (List/Set/Queue). Collections = utility class (static helpers).</p> <p>Q42. ArrayList vs LinkedList vs Vector. ArrayList: random access, dynamic array. LinkedList: fast insert/delete mid, queue/deque. Vector: legacy synchronized.</p> <p>Q43. HashSet vs TreeSet vs LinkedHashSet. HashSet: no order, O(1). TreeSet: sorted, O(log n), no null. LinkedHashSet: insertion order.</p> <p>Q44. HashMap vs TreeMap vs LinkedHashMap. HashMap: no order, allows null. TreeMap: sorted by key, no null key. LinkedHashMap: insertion order.</p> <p>Q45. Comparable vs Comparator. Comparable = natural ordering inside class; Comparator = external multiple orderings.</p> <p>Q46. Iterator and safe removal. Use iterator.remove() or <code>removeIf</code>; avoid modifying during enhanced for.</p> <p>Q47. Fail-fast vs fail-safe iterators. Fail-fast (ArrayList, HashMap) throw CME on modification. Fail-safe (ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList) work on snapshot.</p> <p>Q48. <code>stream()</code> vs <code>parallelStream()</code>. Sequential vs parallel processing; order guarantees differ; use parallel for large CPU-bound tasks when order not critical.</p> <p>Q49. Queue, Deque, PriorityQueue. Queue FIFO; Deque double-ended; PriorityQueue ordered by priority/comparator.</p> <p>Q50. Map.Entry iteration methods. <code>entrySet()</code>, <code>keySet()</code>, <code>values()</code>, <code>forEach</code>, streams.</p> <p>Q51. Fail-fast vs fail-safe collections (expanded). Fail-fast throw CME on concurrent modification; fail-safe use copy/snapshot (no CME, may not reflect latest).</p> <p>Q52. Stream ops: filter/map/flatMap/reduce/collect. Examples for even filter, mapping, flattening, reducing sum/product, collecting to list/set/map/grouping.</p> <p>Q53. Array vs ArrayList. Fixed vs dynamic size; primitives allowed in arrays; ArrayList objects only; richer API.</p> <p>Q54. Difference List vs Set vs Map.
