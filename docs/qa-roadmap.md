## QA fundamentals

- What is Quality Assurance?
- QA mindset and learning the fundamentals
- Test planning, prioritization, and managing QA projects
- Test oracles, verification & validation

## Development methodologies

- Agile models: Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), SAFe
- Waterfall, V-model
- SDLC delivery (UAT, project management tools like YouTrack, Trello, JamaStack)

## Test design & execution

- Testing approaches: White box, gray box, black box
- Functional testing → unit, integration, regression, smoke, sanity, exploratory, UAT
- Non-functional testing → load, performance, stress, security, accessibility
- Test-driven development (TDD)

## Automation tooling

- **Frontend automation:** Playwright, Cypress, Jest, Jasmine, Nightwatch, Puppeteer, WebdriverIO, QA Wolf, Robot, Headless Chrome/Firefox, HTMLUnit, Selenium, Ajax caching
- **Backend automation:** REST Assured, SoapUI, Postman/Newman, Karate framework
- **Mobile automation:** Appium, XCUITest, Espresso, Detox
- **Automation frameworks:** Browser/DevTools, QA Wolf, Robot, SWAs/PWAs/JAMStack considerations, accessibility tests (Wave, AXE)
- **Headless testing** best practices

## Testing infrastructure

- CI/CD runners: Jenkins, TeamCity, Drone, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Travis CI, Bamboo, Azure DevOps Services
- Version control: Git (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab)
- Repo hosting services and automation integrations
- Monitoring & Observability: Kibana, Datadog, Grafana, Sentry, New Relic, Runscope
- Reporting tools: Allure, JUnit

## Performance & reliability

- Load/performance tooling: Gatling, K6, Artillery, Locust, Vegeta, Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- Monitoring critical signals (PagerDuty, Grafana dashboards)
- Email/security testing helpers: Mailinator, Secrets Management, Gmail Tester, Vulnerability scanning, OWASP Top 10

## Supporting tools

- Project test management: qTest, TestRail, TestLink, Zephyr
- Issue tracking & collaboration: Atlassian, Assembla
- Browser addons: Chrome DevTools, Browser addons for responsive/adaptive testing, Selenium IDE, Ghost Inspector, Bug Magnet
- CSR vs SSR considerations for automation

## Headless & security-focused QA

- Headless browsers, security testing pipelines, authentication/authorization automation
- Dynamic testing with real-time monitoring (Grafana/Sentry/New Relic)
